# GraphQL - Let's put REST to rest
This is the repository for the corresponding workshop to be covered during dotNetConf 2018 in Medellin,  CO.

## How to navigate
The workshop is divided in units, and each one has several stages, all of them correspond to a different branch. 

So, start by checking out branch "0_1_Initial".

```
git checkout 0_1_Initial
```

Follow the steps described in the README, and once you're ready to verify your implementation, navigate in your browser to the next branch.

You can fast-forward some steps simply by means of checking out the desired branch, just remember Git won't let you switch branches if you have changes to existing files, so reset any changes with `git reset --hard` before checkout and you'll be good to go.
