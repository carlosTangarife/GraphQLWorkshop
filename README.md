# GraphQL - Let's put REST to rest
This is the repository for the corresponding workshop to be covered during dotNetConf 2018 in Medellin,  CO.

## Where we were?

### 0_1_Initial
- ~~Defined a set of prerequisites.~~
- ~~Created the solution.~~ 
- ~~Created the server project and added all the basic files and dependencies we need.~~ 
- ~~Got a dumb GraphiQL interface.~~

### 0_2_Server_Basic
- Created a class library project to handle our Issues logic.
- Created two models: `User` and `Issue`.
- Following a service repository pattern, we created the corresponding interfaces for those entities and implemented them.
- Registered all the services in the .NET Core DI container.

## 0_3_Library_Basic

This is the end of section 0. There's nothing much to see here apart from how the basic implementation of the server and the library should look like.

Try running the application and verify you don't get build or runtime errors.

Feel free to jump to section 1. The fun is about to come.
